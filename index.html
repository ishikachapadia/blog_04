            <p>This article addresses a fake AI generated image showing an explosion that apparently occured in the Pentagon building. Authorities later confirmed that no such event has occured and the image is fake. After this event, some expressed how dangerous imagae genrative software would be if it was not regulated. In my opinion, I totally agree with this because this could be dangerous as it can spread chaos, even for a short period of time. Before the authorities confirmed the image to be fake, people would obviously have freaked out and this would result in chaos. Some people do think that there should be regulations on what you can generate via AI softwares and I agree with this. Bears with scary teeth is fine, images that suggests sommeone being potentially harmed should not be allowed to generate. The person who generated the former image has not been found and no charges have been made. </p>
